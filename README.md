(To be revised:)
* In short: Beautiful (hopefully) site featuring self-made "games", using "physics" & featuring "simulations", probably.

* General layout (current): See notes. (on paper)
* currently planned sims:
  * Bouncing balls
  * spring stuff. (with weights)

* Currently planned games:
  * Minigolf
  + pong
  - flappy bird?
  * Even more!?

* Scoreboard with server side stuff (php).
